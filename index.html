          <h2>About Me</h2>
          <p>
            In September 2022, I joined the Department of Astronomy &amp;
            Astrophysics at the University of Toronto. For my thesis work, I
            study the evolution of stellar binaries in the centers of galaxies,
            and I'm advised by Drs. Yanqin Wu and Scott Tremaine (CITA, IAS). My
            past work has focused on the dynamics of planetary systems, and I'm
            interested in a broad range of astrophysical problems.
          </p>
          <p>
            I'm passionate about developing my science communication skills and
            working with other academics to get the public excited about space!
            I'm part of a team of UofT students and postdocs developing
            coding-forward astronomy materials for high school students. I also
            wrote for Astrobites and served on their Education committee, and I
            helped lead UofT's monthly Astrotours lectures.

              Stellar binaries orbiting supermassive black holes are likely
              involved in a range of (often observable) astronomical processes.
              These processes depend on the typical properties of this binary
              population. This population should be sculpted by a range of
              dynamical effects; each binary will be incessantly perturbed both
              by the supermassive black hole and the other stars in the dense
              cluster around it.
            </p>
            <p>
              In this work, we show that these effects will cause a surprisingly
              large fraction of the binaries in these environments to take on
              highly elliptical orbits, to the point that their closest approach
              during an orbit can be as small as a few stellar radii. At such
              small separations, in an extremely elliptical orbit, the two stars
              raise significant dynamical tides on each other. These tides
              rapidly shrink the binary orbit, leaving the pair separated by
              just a few times their own radii. We find that this "diffusive
              tidal shrinking" should act on roughly half of the binaries in the
              central few parsecs of the Milky Way, for example, and suggest
              that it should sculpt the binary population in the central part of
              any galaxy with a supermassive black hole.

              Start with two objects in space (stars, asteroids, black holes,
              whatever you like!) that are unbound from each other. If you throw
              them at each other, they will interact gravitationally. However,
              it's impossible for them to form a permanent binary pairing
              unless you have some way to get rid of energy.
            </p>
            <p>
              For the last few years, researchers have studied this process for
              stellar-mass black holes in the gaseous disks that sometimes crop
              up around supermassive black holes at the centers of galaxies.
              There should be a lot of solo stellar-mass black holes in these
              regions, and there's a lot of background gas in the disk, so
              perhaps you can form a lot of binary pairs with these
              stellar-mass black holes. If you form a lot of binaries, the
              conditions are also amenable for the black holes to spiral into
              each other and merge, inducing gravitational waves detectable by
              LIGO/Virgo.
            </p>
            <p>
              But how easy is it to actually form a binary in this way? In this
              work, we take a simple approach to the problem of gas-driven
              pairings, and we introduce the idea that stars in the centers of
              galaxies can lead to binary formation in much the same way. We run
              over 100 million simulations of objects approaching each other
              under dissipative forces, covering a much wider range of this
              problem's vast parameter space than past works. We find simple
              relationships between the properties of the gas disk or
              surrounding stars and the efficacy of binary formation, and we
              compile recent results from other researchers to show that they've
              been finding the same relationships. We also point out that our
              understanding of these gas disks is really very uncertain, and
              that different models give hugely different rates of binary
              formation, which present problems for constraining this channel of
              LIGO/Virgo source formation.

              Conveniently, everything about this work is scale-free, so the
              results can be applied to completely different scenarios – like
              the formation of binary asteroids in the gas disks of a nascent
              planetary system. Let me know if you have a good use-case!

            I've served as a TA in astronomy courses for non-majors at both
            Princeton (~150 students) and Toronto (~1500 students). Through
            these courses, I've gained a wealth of experience in simplifying
            complex problems and getting people excited to dig into the messy
            details of astrophysics. More recently, I've been a TA for second-
            and third-year astronomy courses.
          </p>
          <p>
            I've also spent a lot of time thinking about how I communicate
            science on a broader scale. During my Bachelor's, I won an award for
            a three-minute, general audience video explaining one of my
            junior-year independent research projects. I also worked for
            several years as a podcast and video editor for The Daily
            Princetonian, developing concision and clarity in my writing and
            building skills across the pipeline of multimedia production. As a
            graduate student, I've written for Astrobites, a blog of daily paper
            summaries geared toward undergraduates interested in science; I
            helped develop a series of workshops for high school students,
            introducing them to coding and astronomy through accessible,
            no-experience-necessary talks and activities; and I attended
            ComSciCon-CAN, a Canada-wide workshop for graduate students
            interested in improving their own science communication.

            I received an A.B. with high honors in Astrophysical Sciences from
            Princeton University (May 2022). I also completed a certificate in
            Planets &amp; Life. As part of the degree, I completed two independent
            research projects in my junior year and an undergraduate thesis
            (see Research section for more on these projects). I focused largely
            on planets and planetary systems like our own, with a strong
            interest in astrobiology as my impetus for studying astronomy in
            general. As I completed my undergraduate thesis under Drs.
            Christopher Spalding and Jeremy Goodman and transitioned into
            graduate school, my interests began to shift from planetary dynamics
            to dynamics as a whole.
