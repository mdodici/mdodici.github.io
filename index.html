				In September 2022, I joined the Ph.D. program in the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics (DADDAA, for short) at the University of Toronto. I'm advised by Drs. Yanqin Wu and Scott Tremaine (CITA, IAS). I'm currently working on projects relating to the early evolution of the Kuiper belt, binary formation in various environments, and quasi-periodic eruptions observed in galactic nuclei. My past work has focused on the dynamics of planetary systems.
			</p>
			<p>
				I'm passionate about developing my own science communication skills and working with other academics to engage the public in astronomy and astrophysics. I write for Astrobites and serve on their Education committee, I help lead DADDAA's monthly Astrotours lectures, and I helped develop a one-day astronomy workshop for high school students in the Greater Toronto Area.

				In May 2022, I received an A.B. with high honors in Astrophysical Sciences from Princeton University. I also completed a certificate (a pseudo-minor) in Planets &amp; Life. As part of the degree, I completed two independent research projects in my junior year and an undergraduate thesis (see Research section below for more on these projects). I focused largely on planets and planetary systems like our own, with a strong interest in astrobiology as my impetus for studying astronomy in general.
			</p>
			<p>
				As I completed my undergraduate thesis under Drs. Christopher Spalding and Jeremy Goodman and transitioned into graduate school, my interests began to shift to from planetary dynamics to dynamics as a whole. Since arriving at the University of Toronto, I've used courses to enrich my intuition for and baseline understanding of a broad range of fields in astrophysics.

				I've served as a TA in astronomy courses for non-majors at both Princeton (~150 students) and Toronto (~1500 students). Through these courses, I've gained a wealth of experience in simplifying complex problems and getting people excited to dig into the messy details of astrophysics.
			</p>
			<p>
				I've also spent a lot of time thinking about how I communicate science on a broader scale. During my Bachelor's, I won an award for a three-minute, general audience video explaining one of my junior-year independent research projects. I also worked for several years as a podcast and video editor for The Daily Princetonian, developing concision and clarity in my writing and building skills across the pipeline of multimedia production. As a graduate student, I've written for Astrobites, a blog of daily paper summaries geared toward undergraduates interested in science; I helped develop a workshop for high school students, introducing them to coding and astronomy through accessible, no-experience-necessary talks and activities; and I attended ComSciCon-CAN, a Canada-wide workshop for graduate students interested in improving their own science communication.
