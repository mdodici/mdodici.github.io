	            I'm a Ph.D. student and dynamicist-in-training in the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics (DADDAA, for short) at the University of Toronto. I'm advised by Drs. Yanqin Wu and Scott Tremaine (CITA, IAS). Currently, I'm working to figure out a question to pursue for the next 4-ish years. My past work has focused on the dynamics of planetary systems, though I've also done some work on the formation of binary black hole binaries. Please reach out to me at mark dot dodici at astro dot utoronto dot ca.
