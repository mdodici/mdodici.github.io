	            In September 2022, I joined the Ph.D. program in the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics (DADDAA, for short) at the University of Toronto. I'm advised by Drs. Yanqin Wu and Scott Tremaine (CITA, IAS). Currently, I'm working to figure out a question to pursue for the next 4-ish years. My past work has focused on the dynamics of planetary systems, though I've also done some work on the formation of binary black hole binaries.

		    Science is useless if we're doing it in a bubble â€” also, space is really cool, and everyone deserves to know. I'm passionate about developing my own science communication skills and working with other academics to engage the public in astronomy and astrophysics. I write for Astrobites and serve on their Education committee, I help lead DADDAA's monthly Astrotours lectures, and in my first year as a graduate student, I helped develop a one-day astronomy workshop for high school students in the Greater Toronto Area.

	  <p>In May 2022, I received an A.B. with high honors in Astrophysical Sciences from Princeton University. I also completed a certificate in Planets &amp; Life. As part of the degree, I completed two independent research projects in my junior year as well as an undergraduate thesis (see Research section below for more on these projects). I focused largely on planets and planetary systems like our own, with a strong interest in astrobiology as my impetus for studying astronomy in general.</p><p>As I completed my undergraduate thesis under Dr. Christopher Spalding and transitioned into graduate school, my interests began to shift to dyanmics as a whole. Since arriving at the University of Toronto, I've used courses to enrich my intuition for and baseline understanding of a broad range of fields in astrophysics.</p></div><div style="
