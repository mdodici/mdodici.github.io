	            In September 2022, I joined the Ph.D. program in the David A. Dunlap Department of Astronomy &amp; Astrophysics (DADDAA, for short) at the University of Toronto. I'm advised by Drs. Yanqin Wu and Scott Tremaine (CITA, IAS). Currently, I'm working to figure out a question to pursue for the next 4-ish years — by summer 2024, I will (hopefully) have advanced to candidacy. My past work has focused on the dynamics of planetary systems, though I've also done some work on the formation of binary black hole binaries.

		    Science is useless if we're doing it in a bubble — also, space is really cool, and everyone deserves to know. I'm passionate about developing my own science communication skills and working with other academics to engage the public in astronomy and astrophysics. I write for Astrobites and serve on their Education committee, I help lead DADDAA's monthly Astrotours lectures, and in my first year as a graduate student, I helped develop a one-day astronomy workshop for high school students in the Greater Toronto Area.
